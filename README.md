## FAQ

**Axiom works in singleplayer but not when I connect to a multiplayer server running the Axiom Paper Plugin. What gives?**

First, the player must be an op on the server. If the player does not have op permissions, run `/op <playername>`. This player must then disconnect from the server and reconnect.

If you're using an alternative solution for permission management, you must give players the `axiom.*` permission.

If players continue to have issues, they can run the `/whynoaxiom` command for more information.
